<h1>Multivariate Anomaly Detection for Memory Leak Identification</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Memory leaks in long-running JVM applications degrade performance gradually and are difficult to detect early.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
JVM heap usage, garbage collection metrics, and system telemetry under simulated leak and non-leak conditions.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
Trained LSTM models on normal behaviour and compared them with density-based approaches such as DBSCAN.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
LSTM models detected anomalies earlier and with fewer false positives.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
Temporal modelling is essential for system-level anomaly detection problems.
